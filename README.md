# CST2208-Project
### This is an CST2208 Project. In this project, I aim to analyze diabetes data and address some important business problems/questions.

•	This project is focused on Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Training using Python.

•	The model dataset is diabets.csv

## Background:
Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.
A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Here, we are analyzing different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe by doing Exploratory Data Analysis and building a classification Model.

## Dataset Information:

### Below is the attribute information:

•	Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

•	Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

•	Blood pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

•	SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)

•	Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) test

•	BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

•	DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.

•	Age: Age in years

•	Outcome: Class variable (0: the person is not diabetic or 1: the person is diabetic)

## Model Training 

•	Get to know the data

•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

•	Data Modelling: Experimenting with different algorithms

•	Model Evaluation: Evaluate using performance metrics

## Conclucion
Accuracy of Logistic Regression model on the train set: 0.76 and Accuracy of the Logictic Regression model on the test set: 0.76;
Accuracy of Random Forest model on the train set: 0.82 and Accuracy of Random Forest model on the test set: 0.77;
Random Forest Model is better.
